# --int-overflow=promote answers a Float whose integer value escapes the
# machine word with a Bignum, as CRuby does. raise keeps the RangeError that
# #4657 put in place of an undefined cast, and pins it in
# float_to_int_out_of_range / float_to_int_boundary, which the promote run
# excludes for exactly this reason (the same list int_overflow_raises is on).
#
# What the mode decides is whether a TYPED slot widens. A boxed receiver is
# already boxed, so it answers the Bignum in both modes; the one exception is
# to_i, which #4665 deliberately left raising on a boxed receiver pending
# #2024, so it widens here and not in raise.
