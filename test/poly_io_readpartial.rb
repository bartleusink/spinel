# IO#readpartial on a boxed (poly) IO handle: the poly-IO arm had no arm for
# the name and answered NoMethodError where CRuby reads. Both forms: the plain
# count, and (count, outbuf) which fills the buffer, rebinds it, and RETURNS
# it (same #3336 semantics as the typed arm); EOF raises EOFError.
