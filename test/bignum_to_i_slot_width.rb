# A Bignum reaching an sp_int slot must answer its own value or refuse it --
# never a different number. The width test was the constant 63, so under
# -m32, where sp_int is 32 bits, a value of 33..63 bits passed it and the
# cast then cut it silently.
#
# Whether a given value is answered or refused depends on the target width
# AND on the overflow mode, so neither can be the assertion here. What holds
# everywhere is the invariant the bug broke: the answer is the value or a
# refusal, and never some other number. Values that fit any width are
# checked exactly, to keep a positive claim in the test.
