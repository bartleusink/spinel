# `<Integer>.method(:sym)` binds the receiver into a synthesized wrapper whose
# receiver parameter is typed by the adapter emission; the bind site stores the
# receiver raw and the thunk ABI reads it as an sp_int only while the parameter
# IS an Integer. Under --int-overflow=promote the widening turned that
# parameter into a box, so the callee read a 16-byte value out of a
# pointer-sized slot and every call ended in NoMethodError or a TypeError
# naming an empty class. Both modes must answer CRuby's values.
