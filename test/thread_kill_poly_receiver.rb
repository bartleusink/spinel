# Thread#kill raised NoMethodError unless the receiver was a local whose
# assignment spinel could trace: a handle taken out of an Array -- or held in
# another object's ivar, which is how a shutdown path keeps it -- reached the
# poly dispatch, which had arms for #join, #alive? and #status but none for
# #kill, so the call compiled to a raise (#4619). A Fiber answers it too, as
# it does #alive?.
