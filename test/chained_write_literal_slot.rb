# target leaks the inner slot's other writes into it: where b later widened
# to Bignum, a was promoted with it and `return [a]` declared an Array of
# Integer while the body built a boxed one -- a C function whose result type
# is not what it returns, which does not compile. The bottom literal is
# written to each target in its own slot type instead.
