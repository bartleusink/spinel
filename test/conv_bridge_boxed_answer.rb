# A user class's #to_int is CRuby's implicit conversion: an Integer is wanted,
# the object has one, so it is called. Spinel reaches a compiled #to_int on a
# BOXED object through a generated bridge, and the bridge only carried classes
# whose #to_int was statically an Integer. What a method answers statically is
# the analysis's business and moves with the mode -- under
# --int-overflow=promote a body of plain `1` can be typed boxed -- so the row
# was dropped and every boxed use of the object raised "no implicit conversion
# of X into Integer" instead of converting.
#
# The protocol is the other way round: call it, then judge the answer. An
# answer of the wrong kind is the TypeError, not the absence of a row.

boxed = [IdxBlk.new, "not an index"]

# a #to_int answering something that is not an Integer is still the TypeError.
# Only the class is pinned here: CRuby names the offending answer ("can't
# convert Wrong to Integer (Wrong#to_int gives String)") where Spinel gives the
# generic text, and that difference is older than this and not what this test
# is about.
