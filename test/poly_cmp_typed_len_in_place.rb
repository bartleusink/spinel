# A boxed comparison whose argument is a typed Array's or Hash's count

# argument that may run the program's code: a loop's condition stored and
# read back its counter on every pass. The count runs no code where the
# program leaves the method alone, so the comparison reads both in place.
# An argument that may write the receiver is still ordered after it.
