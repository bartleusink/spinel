# spinel: int64 -- assumes a 64-bit Integer (values or arithmetic past 2^31); not run on a 32-bit target
# What makes a mark more expensive: who ALLOCATED the graph, or who marks it?
#
# #4384 ends with a per-object trace cost that rises with the worker count over
# a graph that did not grow -- the root walk is 0.000 s at every worker count,
# so it is the trace itself. This program separates the two candidates. Both
# arms build the same graph and hold it live while every worker allocates
# garbage around it, so the collections that follow mark identical objects with
# an identical pool. Only the number of workers that laid the graph down
# differs:
#
#   LOCALITY_BUILD=1   one green thread allocates the whole graph
#   LOCALITY_BUILD=N   N green threads allocate 1/N of it each
#
# The answer, measured with ns/object = mark seconds / objects marked (Apple M4
# Max -- 12 performance cores in two clusters of six, 16 MiB of L2 per cluster,
# no conventional L3 -- both budgets pinned, two passes per cell). THE LADDER
# BELOW IS ONE MACHINE'S, and that turned out to be the whole of it: see the
# paragraph after the second table.
# `parts` is the participant count the [gc] line reports -- see the third
# control below, which is why the column is here at all:
#
#   W    parts   BUILD=1   BUILD=8
#   1      2      4.37      4.12     <- the control: 8 green threads, ONE worker
#   2      3      4.09      5.53
#   4      5      4.12      5.56
#   8      9      4.08      5.85
#   12    13      4.15      5.89
#
# BUILD=1 is flat across the ladder; the rise is only in the arm where more
# than one worker allocated. The W=1 row is what makes that a statement about
# workers rather than about the graph: BUILD=8 there still builds eight
# separate lists from eight green threads, and costs what BUILD=1 costs,
# because one worker did all of the allocating.
#
# Holding the pool at W=8 and varying only the builders shows it is a STEP and
# not a gradient -- 4.08, 5.65, 5.72, 5.68, 5.87 ns/object at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16
# builders. The first extra allocator costs 39%; the next fourteen cost nothing.
#
# WHAT THE STEP IS NOT, AND WHERE IT IS NOT (#4384). This file first read the
# step as allocation locality -- one worker laying a linked structure down in
# traversal order, and any interleaving destroying that. IT IS NOT THAT, and
# the numbers above should not be quoted as if it were:
#
#   * The ADDRESSES are the same in both arms. Walked in traversal order on the
#     machine above, the stride from one node to the next is 80 B at one builder
#     and 80 B at eight, 98% of steps stay inside one 4 KB page in every arm,
#     and 69 steps out of 399,999 cross more than 1 MB. Object-granularity
#     interleaving would put ~NODES of them there.
#   * It is not CACHE CAPACITY. The ratio holds at ~1.3x from a 5 MB graph that
#     fits in a cluster's L2 to an 88 MB graph that does not. A capacity effect
#     would have a knee; this has none.
#   * It is not the per-worker STRING heap, which is the only per-worker list
#     spinel owns (sp_gc_alloc is a plain calloc plus a CAS push onto ONE global
#     heap list -- nothing recycles object storage). Give Node an Integer
#     payload instead of a String and the step survives at ~1.5x.
#   * It is NOT ON EITHER LINUX BOX IT HAS BEEN RUN ON. On an AMD Ryzen 5 3600
#     (6 cores, 2 CCX) the ladder is 16.9 - 18.2 ns/object across every cell,
#     BUILD=8 marginally the faster arm, participant control verified.
#
# So the step is one machine's, the worker axis on that machine (1.27x) is far
# short of the application ladder it was extracted to explain (2.04x, measured
# on the Ryzen box), and no allocator or placement change should be started
# from it. What this program still earns its place for is the CORRECTNESS
# property below, which holds on every box.
#
# TO RUN THE LADDER, with the three controls that make it mean anything. All
# three silently invalidate it and none of them warns:
#
#   for W in 1 2 4 8 12; do
#     LOCALITY_BUILD=$B LOCALITY_CHURN=16 LOCALITY_NODES=400000 LOCALITY_ROUNDS=12000 \
#     SPINEL_WORKERS=$W SPINEL_GC_OBJ_BUDGET=fixed SPINEL_GC_STR_BUDGET=fixed \
#     SPINEL_GC_THRESHOLD_OBJ_KB=$((65536/W)) SPINEL_GC_THRESHOLD_STR_KB=$((65536/W)) \
#     SPINEL_GC_PHASES=1 ./gc_locality_build
#   done
#
#   1. THE PINNED FLOOR MUST SIT ABOVE THE LIVE SET. With OBJ_BUDGET=fixed the
#      threshold never re-aims, so a floor under the live set trips on every
#      allocation and the run livelocks -- tens of thousands of collections
#      where it should take dozens, with nothing said about it. At
#      LOCALITY_NODES=400000 the graph is ~35 MB, so 64 MB aggregate is a
#      floor and 32 MB is a livelock.
#   2. THE OBJECT FLOOR IS MULTIPLIED AT THE FIRST Thread.new, NOT AT BOOT.
#      A graph built before any thread exists is allocated under a different
#      budget from one built after, which is exactly what separates the arms.
#      Both arms therefore build from inside threads, and the warm-up thread
#      below runs first so the pool and the multiply already exist when either
#      one starts.
#   3. LOCALITY_CHURN CAPS THE POOL, SO SPINEL_WORKERS ALONE DOES NOT SET IT.
#      The scheduler grows the pool toward one worker per LIVE GREEN THREAD,
#      so the churn thread count -- not the cap -- is what decides how many
#      workers a cell actually runs. At LOCALITY_CHURN=4 the participant count
#      reads 6 at both SPINEL_WORKERS=8 and 12, which is to say those two
#      cells are the same run under two labels. Give LOCALITY_CHURN at least the
#      largest W on the ladder and read `str/worker x N` back to check; the
#      table above carries that column for exactly this reason.
#
# The defaults here are sized for the gate, not for the ladder: small enough
# to run with the suite, large enough to collect, and with eight churn threads
# so that the leg's SPINEL_WORKERS=8 arm really is eight workers (see 3). The checksum is the same in
# every arm and at every worker count -- a graph built by N workers is the
# graph built by one -- which is what gc-locality-test asserts.
