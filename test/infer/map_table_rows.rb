# A table of rows built by `map` over another table's rows. The mapped table
# holds the SAME row objects -- `cols[k]` is not a copy -- so the two tables
# must agree on a row kind, and the mapped one can be an sp_PtrArray of row
# pointers like any other table.
#
# narrow_object_arrays had no arm for a map source, so the slot died and the
# table stayed a boxed poly array: every row was boxed on the way in and
# unboxed again on every read. The identical table built with a `while` loop
# and `<<` narrowed, so the representation depended only on which builder was
# used. The kind is an EDGE to the source table rather than element evidence,
# because the source's own kind is still being derived in the same round.
