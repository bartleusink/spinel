# The inference fixpoint has a 128-round cap. Reaching it is not a slow path,
# it is a non-answer: the loop stops because the cap says so, mid-oscillation,
# and where it stops decides which of two typings gets emitted. Both typings
# usually pass the test -- a boxed slot prints the same answer as a typed one --
# so nothing else in the suite can see it. (#4116)

# `require "pathname"` alone used to reach the cap, twice, and cost a 53k-line
# tree 124.6s in the front end against 11.5s converged.
