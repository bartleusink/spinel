# A method containing `yield` that ALSO uses its `&blk` as a value.
#
# `yield` marks a method for inlining at its call sites, where the block is
# spliced and the &blk slot is virtual -- no storage is emitted for it. Every
# use of blk that is not a call still named that storage, so the C failed to
# compile: `use of undeclared identifier 'lv_blk'` (or `_cell_blk` when a
# nested proc captured it). The escape analysis already refuses to splice such
# a method; a literal `yield` set the inline mark anyway and nothing took it
# back. Lowering it to the real &block-proc form is what the self-recursive and
# the Thread-body yielders already do.
