# diff_classify.rb -- the label `spinel diff` puts on a comparison, and the
# exit status that label maps to. One function over the observations, so the
# order of precedence is in one place and tested as a unit
# (test/tools_diff_classify.rb). Written in the spinel subset.
#
# Labels, in the order they are decided:
#   compile-error    spinel refused the program (no C came out)
#   link-error       the C came out but cc did not build it
#   crash            the spinel binary ended on a signal
#   timeout          a run passed the time limit (never counted as a pass)
#   nondeterministic the spinel binary disagreed with its own second run
#   exception-diff   the uncaught exception differs (presence, class, message)
#   output-diff      both ran to an end and stdout or the exit status differs
#   same             no difference
# `known-gap` is decided by the caller from the minimized program (B-2).
#
# Exit status: 0 same, 1 a difference (output-diff, exception-diff, timeout,
# nondeterministic), 2 compile-error / link-error, 3 crash, 4 the tool's own
# error. CI reads these; they are a contract.

# One run's observations. `status` is the exit status (-1 when it did not
# run), `signal` the terminating signal name or "" , `timed_out` 1/0.
